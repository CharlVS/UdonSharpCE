# UdonSharpCE Project Context

UdonSharpCE is a custom fork of UdonSharp maintained by us. As the developers, we can make changes to the compiler and tooling as needed.

## Priorities

- **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Prioritize clean, intuitive APIs and helpful error messages
- **C# Parity**: Provide a simple, abstracted experience that stays close to standard C# conventions and patterns
- **Maintainability**: We own this fork—prefer proper fixes over workarounds
